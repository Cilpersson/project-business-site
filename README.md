# What is this
My second project during the Technigo bootcamp. 
Assignment: **Build a Business Site**.

## How I started
After reading/watching/doing all the course material and assignments for week 3 I started by drawing a proper layout for my website. I drew all the different containers and the elements that where meant to be in them. This was something that really helped me to know what to do next and I felt as if I was a few steps ahead all the time. 
 
### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project
I did not manage to understand how HTML media queries for videos work. Neither how to add several sources to one video tag. I spent more than one full day trying different methods but nothing seemed to work. Instead I added the queries to CSS and made 3 different video classes in HTML. Then there was no issue, thankfully. 

I should have asked for help instead of going down the google rabbit hole alone. That's something I should improve for next week, asking for help earlier. 

### What I'm proud of
I'm really proud that I found another way to create the hero video header. I was thinking about just doing a picture header instead, but I didn't give up. The layer with colour and the transparent image are also features I'm  happy that I figured out how use. 

I'm also proud that I used the pseudo class nth-child for my accordion and that I have a + and - sign when it opens and closes.

## If I had more time
I would have tried to do some sort of animation to either the accordion or my title.
